# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning (R)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts diabetes using machine learning models:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The dataset was preprocessed using:
- Missing value imputation
- Outlier handling
- Feature transformation
- Standardization

## 📊 Models & Evaluation
Models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC–AUC

## 🔍 Key Findings
- SVM achieved the highest ROC–AUC (0.847)
- Glucose and BMI were the most important risk factors

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- R
- caret
- randomForest
- e1071
- pROC
- ggplot2
